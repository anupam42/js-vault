## Explain IIFE with an example


[IIFE](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/IIFE) 

An IIFE (Immediately Invoked Function Expression) is a JavaScript function that runs as soon as it is defined.


### Question
What is IIFE in Javascript? Hot it works? Write an example.

### Thought process Pseudocode
1. Write a function to log some message for example
```javascript
function foo() {
  console.log('my log message');
}
```

2. For now it's not called. You can call it with name of function and parentheses. Call function and see log message in console
```javascript
foo();

/**
my log message
**/
```

3. But also you can call it immediately as IIFE. You need to put your function definition into parentheses and add parentheses to call it. Give a try:

<Editor />

### Solution
```javascript
(function foo() {
  console.log('my log message');
})();

// or function can be anonymous

(function() {
    console.log('my log message');
})();
``` 

### Caveat
You can't use IIFE without parentheses on initialization.

```javascript
// NON WORKING EXAMPLE
(function () {
	console.log('my log');	
});
```

You should add parentheses on end of function initialization:

```javascript
// WORKING EXAMPLE
(function () {
	console.log('my log');	
})();
```
